  "title": "Data Science is Everywhere (Including Your Classroom)",
  "body": " Data Science is Everywhere (Including Your Classroom)  Before we dive deeper, let's see how data science thinking already connects to different subjects. Each subject area offers natural entry points for developing data skills and thinking habits.    Students are analyzing word frequency in different authors' writing styles. Which subject area does this best fit, and why?    Think about where students would naturally study authors, writing techniques, and literary analysis.    English Language Arts - this connects directly to literary analysis and understanding writing style differences.    This fits best in English Language Arts because students are analyzing literature and writing techniques. While math skills are involved in counting and comparing, the primary focus is on understanding how different authors use language. This shows how data science enhances rather than replaces traditional ELA instruction.      A class wants to use census data to understand how their community has changed over the past 20 years. What subject area provides the best context for this investigation?    Consider which subject focuses on communities, demographics, and change over time.    Social Studies - this investigation focuses on understanding communities, demographics, and historical change.    Social Studies provides the best context because this investigation is fundamentally about understanding society and how communities change over time. While students will use math skills to analyze the data and might write about their findings, the core learning objectives align with social studies standards about demographics, community development, and historical change.     Identifying Data Science Across Subjects   Let's practice recognizing how data science thinking appears naturally in different subjects.     Think of a lesson you've taught recently (or plan to teach). How could you incorporate a simple data collection or analysis activity?    Consider activities like surveying opinions, counting occurrences, comparing quantities, or tracking changes over time.      What questions might students ask as they work with this data? How would you encourage deeper investigation?    Think about follow-up questions like What patterns do you notice? or What surprises you?      Notice how data science thinking can enhance your existing curriculum rather than adding new content!    Data science thinking appears across all subject areas because it's about enhancing what you're already teaching with intentional attention to curiosity (asking questions that can be explored with information), critical thinking (questioning sources, recognizing bias, and evaluating claims), problem-solving (using data to understand and address real-world issues), and communication (sharing findings clearly and persuasively).    This 6-minute video shows how data science naturally fits into everyday teaching across subjects.   The data science learning progressions you'll be working with are organized into five interconnected strands. You can explore the complete progressions at the learning progressions website .   1. Data Dispositions and Responsibilities: Developing curiosity, ethics, and critical thinking about data   2. Creation and Curation: Collecting, cleaning, and organizing data for analysis   3. Analysis and Modeling: Making sense of data through various techniques and tools   4. Interpreting Problems and Results: Drawing conclusions and making claims based on evidence   5. Visualization and Communication: Sharing data stories effectively with different audiences  These strands spiral through grade levels, building sophistication over time. A kindergartener sorting objects by color is developing the same fundamental thinking as a high school student analyzing complex datasets—just at different levels of complexity.    What's the most important thing to understand about how the five data science strands work together?    Think about whether these strands should be taught separately or together, and how they build over time.    The strands are interconnected and should be woven together, building sophistication as students progress through grade levels.    The five strands work together in every data science activity. When students do a simple class survey, they're practicing curiosity and ethics (Strand 1), collecting and organizing information (Strand 2), making sense of patterns (Strand 3), drawing conclusions (Strand 4), and sharing results (Strand 5). The complexity increases over time, but even kindergarteners can engage with all five strands in age-appropriate ways.     Don't Feel Overwhelmed!  You don't need to master all five strands immediately. This resource is designed to help you start where you are and build confidence gradually. Most teachers find that beginning with just one strand—often Data Dispositions and Responsibilities or Visualization and Communication—feels most natural.   This resource adapts to where you are in your teaching journey. Consider which description best fits your primary teaching context:   Elementary (K-5): I work with younger students who learn best through hands-on activities, concrete examples, and visual representations.   Secondary (6-12): I work with older students who can handle more abstract concepts and sophisticated tools like spreadsheets or coding platforms.   Mixed\/Other: I work across grade levels, in specialized settings, or want to see examples from multiple levels.   Based on your teaching context, what type of data science activities do you think would work best with your students? Consider their developmental level, attention span, and interests.   Throughout this resource, you'll see examples tailored to different contexts. Elementary teachers will see examples using manipulatives, simple surveys, and picture graphs. Secondary teachers will see examples with spreadsheet tools, data visualization software, and introductory coding. You can always explore examples from other grade bands—data science thinking is remarkably adaptable!  Let's end this chapter with something you can try in your classroom this week. Here's a simple 15-minute activity that works in any subject and any grade level:   The Quick Class Survey   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: Paper\/whiteboard or digital tool of your choice   What to do:   1. Ask your students a question related to your current topic. Examples: Math: How many pets do you have? Science: What's your favorite weather? Social Studies: How do you get to school? ELA: What's your favorite book genre?   2. Collect responses quickly (show of hands, exit ticket, etc.)  3. Create a simple visual representation together (tally marks, bar graph, etc.)  4. Ask: What do you notice? What surprises you? What questions does this raise?   5. Connect back to your lesson: How might this information be useful for...?    Why this works: You've just engaged all five data science strands in 15 minutes! Students practiced questioning (Data Dispositions), collecting information (Creation and Curation), organizing it (Analysis), interpreting results (Interpreting Problems and Results), and communicating findings (Visualization and Communication).     Watch this 3-minute example of a teacher implementing a quick class survey with 4th graders.     What do you think is the most important part of the Quick Class Survey for developing data science thinking?    Consider which step helps students move beyond just collecting data to actually thinking about what it means.    Asking follow-up questions like What do you notice? and What surprises you?     The follow-up questions are crucial because they develop investigative thinking skills—the heart of data science. While technology and sample size can be important, this activity is about developing thinking habits. The questions help students move from passive data collection to active investigation and analysis.     After You Try It  After trying this activity, consider these questions: What did your students notice that surprised you? What questions did they ask that you hadn't thought of? How might you extend this activity next time? What connections do you see to your curriculum standards?   "

  "title": "Building Your Confidence: You’re Already a Data Science Teacher",
  "body": " Building Your Confidence: You're Already a Data Science Teacher  Many teachers feel intimidated by data science because they think it requires advanced mathematical or technical knowledge. The truth is, if you're helping students think critically about information, ask questions, and communicate their findings, you're already teaching data science.   Recognizing Data Science in Your Teaching   Let's identify the data science thinking that's already happening in common classroom activities.     Consider this activity: Students sort objects by color, size, or shape. What data science skills does this develop?    Categorizing and organizing information - foundational data skills      What about: Students create a bar graph showing class favorite foods?     Data visualization and communication skills      And: Students analyze different perspectives on a historical event using multiple sources?     Critical evaluation of evidence and bias recognition     Each of these activities involves data science thinking! The progression shows how concepts naturally build from basic categorization to sophisticated analysis.    Let's address some concerns teachers often have about data science education:    A teacher says: I don't have time to add another subject to my curriculum. How would you respond to this concern?    Think about whether data science replaces existing content or enhances it.    Data science thinking enhances what you're already teaching rather than adding new content.    Data science is a way of thinking that makes existing curriculum richer and more engaging. Instead of adding content, it adds depth to current lessons. A math lesson about graphing becomes more meaningful when students graph data they collected about something they care about. A social studies lesson about community becomes more engaging when students analyze real data about their own community.      Another teacher worries: I'm not strong in math, so I can't teach data science. What's the most accurate response?    Consider what skills are most important for data science thinking at the foundational level.    The most important data science skills are curiosity, critical thinking, and communication.    While math becomes more important at higher levels, the foundation of data science is about thinking clearly about information. Many crucial data science concepts don't require advanced math: questioning data sources, recognizing patterns, organizing information, and communicating findings clearly. These are skills that teachers use every day.    The key insight: Data science education is about developing ways of thinking that transcend any single subject or mathematical skill level. You're preparing students to be thoughtful consumers and creators of information—a skill they'll need regardless of their career path.  "

In the following modules, we'll dive deeper into each of the five data science strands, always keeping the focus on practical applications you can use immediately.  Remember: you don't need to become a data scientist to teach data science thinking. You just need to be curious, willing to learn alongside your students, and ready to help them develop the critical thinking skills they'll need for the rest of their lives.    This 5-minute video preview shows what you'll learn in the upcoming modules.     What's the most important thing to remember as you begin implementing data science education in your classroom?    Think about sustainable change versus trying to do everything at once.    Start small with activities you feel comfortable with and build from there.    Building confidence through small successes creates sustainable change in your teaching practice. You don't need to master all technical tools before starting - simple activities using basic materials work great. The best learning happens when you try things with your students as you learn, so start experimenting right away with activities that feel manageable.     What's one specific thing you'll try in your classroom this week based on what you've learned in this chapter?   Ready to continue? In the next module, we'll explore Data Dispositions and Responsibilities —the foundation of all data science thinking.

  "title": "Building Data Curiosity and Questioning Skills",
  "body": " Building Data Curiosity and Questioning Skills  Data science begins with curiosity—wondering about the world and asking questions that can be explored through information. But not all questions are data questions. Let's explore what makes a good question for data investigation and how to help students develop this skill.    A student asks, What's the best color? Why wouldn't this make a good data investigation question?    Think about whether this question can be answered objectively through collecting information.    This is purely opinion-based with no objective answer that data could reveal.    While you could survey people about color preferences, there's no objective best color to discover through data. Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information. A better version might be What colors do students in our class prefer for their bedroom walls? This transforms opinion into investigable preferences within a specific population.     The Question Transformation Game   When students ask broad or opinion-based questions, help them reshape their curiosity into something investigable.     A student asks, Why is math hard? How could you transform this into a data question?    Think about making it specific and measurable while honoring the student's curiosity.     What math topics do students in our class find most challenging?       Try another: Why do people like music?     Consider focusing on specific, measurable aspects of music preferences.     What types of music are most popular among students in different grade levels?      The key is transforming general curiosity into specific, measurable questions that students can investigate through data collection.     Try This Week: Curiosity Starters   Time needed: 10 minutes during any lesson   How it works: Use these sentence starters to help students generate data questions related to your current topic.   Elementary (K-5) Starters:  I wonder how many... , Which one is more popular... , Do most kids in our class... , How often does...    Secondary (6-12) Starters:  What factors influence... , How has [topic] changed over time... , What's the relationship between... , Do students who [X] also tend to [Y]...    Example in action: During a lesson on weather (Science), a student uses I wonder how many... to ask I wonder how many rainy days we have each month? Perfect! Now you have a data investigation opportunity.     Watch this 4-minute classroom example of a teacher using question starters with 3rd graders.    Choose a lesson you're planning this week. Write down two question starters that would fit naturally into that lesson and help students generate data questions.   One of the most powerful routines for developing data curiosity is Notice and Wonder. This simple strategy works with any content and naturally leads students toward data thinking.   Try This Week: Notice and Wonder   Time needed: 10 minutes, works with any content   The Strategy: Whenever you present any information to students (a graph, a historical fact, a scientific observation), pause and ask: What do you notice? and What do you wonder?    Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences: Students might notice: Dogs got twice as many votes as cats or Nobody chose fish. Students might wonder: Would this be the same in other classes? or Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?    The magic: This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.   Bonus: Keep a running list of student wonders throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!     Look at this student response: I wonder if lunch preferences change during different seasons. Is this a notice (observation) or a wonder (question for investigation)?    Consider whether this is describing what they see or asking something that could be investigated.    This is a wonder - a question that could lead to further data investigation.    This is definitely a wonder because it poses a question that students could investigate by collecting data across different seasons. Notices would be observations like Pizza got the most votes or There are more boys than girls in this data.  Wonders are the questions that emerge from those observations and lead to new investigations.    "

Students might wonder: Would this be the same in other classes? or Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?    The magic: This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.   Bonus: Keep a running list of student wonders throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!  "

  "body": "  Look at this student response: I wonder if lunch preferences change during different seasons. Is this a notice (observation) or a wonder (question for investigation)?    Consider whether this is describing what they see or asking something that could be investigated.    This is a wonder - a question that could lead to further data investigation.    This is definitely a wonder because it poses a question that students could investigate by collecting data across different seasons. Notices would be observations like Pizza got the most votes or There are more boys than girls in this data.  Wonders are the questions that emerge from those observations and lead to new investigations.   "

  "title": "Recognizing Bias and Developing Ethical Data Thinking",
  "body": " Recognizing Bias and Developing Ethical Data Thinking  One of the most important data dispositions is healthy skepticism. Not all data tells the complete story, and students need to develop the habit of asking: What might this data be missing? Who collected this and why? Additionally, when we collect information about people, we have responsibilities.    This 5-minute video explains bias in data collection in kid-friendly terms.   Let's explore bias through a simple scenario that works for any age:   The Playground Survey Problem   The Scenario: Jamie wants to find out what the most popular playground activity is at their school. They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say basketball is their favorite.   Jamie's conclusion:  Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!    What questions should we ask about this conclusion? Where did Jamie conduct the survey? When did they survey? Who did they ask? How did they ask the question? What other information might be helpful?     In the playground survey scenario, what would likely be the MOST significant source of bias?    Think about how the location of data collection might influence the responses.    Jamie probably surveyed students near the basketball court, creating location bias.    Location bias is the biggest issue here. If Jamie surveyed students who were playing basketball or near the basketball court, those students would be much more likely to say basketball is their favorite activity. This shows how WHERE we collect data can significantly influence the results, even with good intentions.      How could Jamie improve their survey to get more reliable results?    Consider ways to make sure all students have an equal chance to participate.    Randomly select students from class lists to survey, rather than surveying based on location.    Random selection from class lists would give every student an equal chance to participate, regardless of which playground activity they prefer. Jamie could also survey at different times and locations, but random selection is the most systematic approach to reducing bias.     Try This Week: Bias Detectives   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: A simple chart, graph, or claim from your curriculum   The Activity: Present any data visualization or claim to your students. Ask them to put on their detective hats and investigate using age-appropriate questions.   Detective Questions for Elementary: Who made this chart? Who did they ask? Who didn't they ask? Does this seem fair?   Detective Questions for Secondary: What was the source of this data? What was the sample size and method? What might be missing from this picture? Who benefits if people believe this claim? What additional information would help us evaluate this?   The goal: Students should become automatically curious about the story behind the data, not just the data itself.     What's the most important thing for students to understand about bias in data?    Think about whether bias is intentional or unintentional, and whether it can be reduced.    Bias is common and often unintentional, but can be reduced by thinking carefully about how data is collected.    Understanding that bias is normal and usually unintentional helps students approach data with healthy skepticism rather than cynicism. Most data collectors aren't trying to mislead—they're just limited by practical constraints. Teaching students to ask good questions about data sources and methods helps them become better consumers and creators of information.    When we collect information about people, we have responsibilities. This is true whether students are surveying classmates about lunch preferences or analyzing historical census data.   Try This Week: Class Data Agreements   Time needed: 20 minutes (one-time setup that lasts all year)  Before any data collection activity, work with your students to create a class agreement about how you'll handle information responsibly.   Elementary Version - Our Data Promise: We will ask before collecting information about each other. We will keep personal information private. We will be kind when sharing what we learn. We will ask for help if we're unsure about something.   Secondary Version - Data Ethics Guidelines: Obtain informed consent before data collection. Anonymize data when sharing results publicly. Consider potential harm or embarrassment to individuals. Be transparent about data collection methods and purpose. Respect the right to withdraw participation.   Pro tip: Refer back to this agreement whenever you do data activities. It becomes a natural part of your classroom culture.     Your class surveys students about how they get to school. One student mentions their family doesn't have a car. What should you do when sharing results with other classes?    Consider how to share useful information while protecting individual privacy.    Share overall patterns without identifying individual responses.    The goal is to protect individual privacy while still sharing useful information about transportation patterns. You could say Most students ride the bus, some walk, and a few get rides without identifying specific students or their family situations. This teaches students to think about the impact of data sharing on real people.     Organizing Ethical Data Practices   Think about the sequence of ethical practices during a classroom data investigation.     What should happen BEFORE students start collecting data?    Explain what information will be collected and how it will be used, then ask for consent.      What should happen DURING data processing?    Remove identifying information before analyzing results.      What should happen WHEN presenting results?    Share findings in ways that protect individual privacy.     Students should also know they can withdraw their data at any time throughout the process.    "

  "title": "Developing an Investigative Mindset and Student Data Agency",
  "body": " Developing an Investigative Mindset and Student Data Agency  The best data scientists aren't necessarily the most technical—they're the most curious and persistent. They ask follow-up questions, notice unexpected patterns, and aren't satisfied with surface-level answers. They also see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data.    This 7-minute video shows students developing investigative thinking through a real classroom data project.    The Question Chain Game  This activity helps students develop the habit of asking follow-up questions—the heart of investigation.   How it works: Start with any simple observation or data point from your subject area. Students practice asking But why? and What else could explain this?    Example Chain (Science\/Elementary): Observation: Most kids in our class like sunny days better than rainy days. → But why do they prefer sunny days? → Do kids in places where it rains a lot feel differently? → Do adults feel the same way as kids? → How do people's daily activities change with weather?    Example Chain (Social Studies\/Secondary): Data point: Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years. → What factors contributed to this increase? → How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status? → What were teens doing with that time before social media? → How do we measure the effects of this change?   Notice how each question opens up new possibilities for investigation? This is the investigative mindset in action.     Starting with Students in our class spend an average of 2 hours on homework each night, what would be a good follow-up question to continue an investigative chain?    Think about questions that could lead to further data investigation and comparison.     How does homework time vary by subject or grade level? or similar investigative questions.    Good follow-up questions could include: How does homework time vary by subject? , What factors might explain differences between students? , or How has this changed over time? The key is asking questions that could lead to further data investigation rather than making judgments or stating personal experiences.    Data agency means students see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data. They don't just consume information—they create it, question it, and use it to make their world better.   From Questions to Action  The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:   Step 1: Start with student concerns - What's something about our school\/community\/world that you're curious about or want to change?    Step 2: Help them find the data angle - What information would help us understand this better? Who could we ask? What could we count or measure?    Step 3: Support investigation planning - How will we collect this information fairly? What do we predict we'll find? Who should know about our results?    Step 4: Celebrate their expertise - What did you discover that adults might not know? How could this information help make decisions? What would you want to investigate next?      When a student proposes investigating something they care about, what's the most important thing to do?    Consider how to maintain their ownership while building their skills.    Help them transform their interest into investigable questions.    This maintains their ownership and motivation while building their skills in formulating data questions. Rather than providing pre-existing datasets or changing their topic to something easier, we honor their curiosity and help them develop the tools to investigate what they care about. This builds both skills and confidence.     Real Examples of Student Data Agency   Consider these examples of students using data to make a difference.    Elementary example: Third graders survey classmates about lunch preferences and present findings to cafeteria staff, leading to a new menu option. What data science skills are they developing?    High school example: Students analyze local census data to understand demographic changes in their community and present findings at a town hall meeting. How does this demonstrate data agency?    In both cases, students see their questions as worthy of investigation and their findings as valuable to decision-makers. This is the heart of data agency.    "

Small, regular practices build habits more effectively than occasional big activities.   Option 1: Monday Question Starters - Every Monday, spend 5 minutes helping students generate data questions about your upcoming week's content using the sentence starters from this module.   Option 2: Wonder Wednesday - Every Wednesday, present one piece of information (graph, fact, image) and ask What do you notice? What do you wonder?    Option 3: Bias Detective Friday - Every Friday, spend 10 minutes examining a claim or data source with your detective questions from this module.   Option 4: Create Your Own - Design a routine that fits your teaching style and subject area, incorporating the key elements of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking.     What's the most important factor in choosing which data dispositions routine to implement in your classroom?    Think about sustainability versus ambition.    Choose the one you can realistically do consistently.    Regular practice builds habits better than ambitious routines that fizzle out after a few weeks.

  "title": "From Questions to Data Collection: Designing Simple Investigations",
  "body": " From Questions to Data Collection: Designing Simple Investigations  Once students have developed good data questions (from Module 1), they need to learn how to collect information to answer those questions. The design of a data investigation is just as important as the analysis—poor collection methods lead to unreliable conclusions.    A student wants to investigate: Do students in our school prefer summer or winter activities? What's the first step in designing this investigation?    Think about what specific information they would need to collect to answer this question.    Define what they mean by summer activities and winter activities and decide who they'll ask.    Before collecting any data, students need to be specific about their terms. What counts as a summer activity? Are we talking about outdoor vs. indoor activities, or activities that can only be done in certain seasons? Who will they survey—the whole school, certain grades, or their class? These planning decisions directly affect what conclusions they can draw from their data.     Try This Week: Simple Investigation Design   Time needed: 20 minutes of planning, plus time for data collection   How it works: Walk students through designing a simple investigation using this framework:   1. Clarify the Question: What exactly are we trying to find out? What do key terms mean?   2. Define the Population: Who will we ask? Everyone in the class? School? Grade level?   3.

  "body": " Data Collection in Practice: Student Surveys and Observations  The most common way students collect data is through surveys and simple observations. While these seem straightforward, there are important considerations that affect the quality and usefulness of the data.   Try This Week: Student Survey Basics   Materials: Paper or simple digital survey tool   Steps for Success:    1. Write Clear Questions: Avoid yes\/no questions when you want more information. Instead of Do you like reading? try How many books do you read per month?    2. Consider Question Order: Start with easy, non-personal questions. Save sensitive topics for later if needed.   3. Test Your Questions: Try the survey with a few students first. Are the questions clear? Do students understand what you're asking?   4. Plan for Different Responses: What if someone doesn't know? What if they have multiple answers? Plan for these situations.   5. Make Recording Easy: Use simple forms, clear handwriting, or digital tools that work reliably.     Which survey question would give you more useful data: Do you exercise? or How many days per week do you exercise for at least 20 minutes?     Consider which question would give you specific, comparable information.    The second question would give more useful data because it's specific and measurable.     How many days per week do you exercise for at least 20 minutes? is much better because it defines what counts as exercise (20+ minutes) and gives you a number you can compare across students. Do you exercise? is too vague—everyone might have different ideas about what exercise means, leading to responses that can't be meaningfully compared.      When should students use observation rather than surveys to collect data?    Think about what types of information can be directly observed versus what requires asking people.    When they can directly see or measure what they're studying, like counting behaviors, measuring objects, or timing activities.    Observation works well for things like: counting how many students choose different lunch options, measuring plant growth, timing how long different activities take, or recording weather conditions. Surveys are better for opinions, preferences, experiences, or information that isn't directly observable (like how students feel about a topic or what they do at home).    Sometimes the most interesting investigations involve students creating their own data through experiments or systematic observations.   Ideas for Student-Generated Data   Elementary Examples:   • Track daily weather and look for patterns over a month  • Count different types of vehicles passing the school during different times  • Measure how far different paper airplane designs fly  • Record which playground activities are most popular at different times of day   Secondary Examples:   • Test how different study environments affect concentration (measured by task completion time)  • Track school recycling data over time and relate it to awareness campaigns  • Compare plant growth under different conditions (light, water, soil type)  • Survey students about career interests and compare across grade levels    Choose one of the examples above (or create your own) that would fit into a lesson you're planning.

  "body": " Organizing and Cleaning Data: From Messy to Meaningful  Real-world data collection is messy. Students might record information inconsistently, miss data points, or make recording errors. Teaching students to organize and clean data helps them understand that data analysis requires careful preparation.    This 6-minute video shows students working with messy data and learning to organize it for analysis.     Students survey classmates about favorite colors and get these responses: blue , Blue , light blue , navy , red , RED , green . What problems do you notice?    Look for inconsistencies in how the same type of response is recorded.    Inconsistent capitalization and unclear categories (are blue , light blue , and navy the same or different?).    This data needs cleaning because: (1) capitalization is inconsistent ( blue vs Blue vs RED ), and (2) it's unclear whether light blue and navy should count as blue or be separate categories. Students need to make decisions about how to group responses consistently before they can analyze the data meaningfully.     Try This Week: Data Organization Practice   Time needed: 15-20 minutes after data collection   Basic Organization Steps:    1. Check for Completeness: Are there any missing responses? Illegible entries?   2. Standardize Formats: Make capitalization consistent, spell out abbreviations, use consistent units.   3. Group Similar Responses: Decide how to handle responses that are similar but not identical.   4. Create Simple Tables: Organize data into rows and columns with clear labels.   5.

Elementary Approach: Work through data organization as a whole class, making decisions together about how to handle problems.   Secondary Approach: Have students work in small groups to clean their data, then compare approaches and discuss which methods work best.    Making Data Cleaning Decisions   Data cleaning often requires making judgment calls about how to handle inconsistent responses.     Students are collecting data about pets and get responses like: dog , puppy , golden retriever , cat , kitten , fish . How should they group these responses?    Consider what level of detail would be most useful for their investigation.    Group by general animal type: dog (including puppy and golden retriever), cat (including kitten), fish .      What if their original question was specifically about dog breeds? How might they handle the data differently?    They might keep golden retriever separate and ask follow-up questions to get breed information for dog and puppy responses.     Data cleaning decisions should always connect back to the original question you're trying to answer.      During a survey about homework time, some students leave the question blank. What are two reasonable ways to handle this missing data?    Consider whether missing responses should be ignored, estimated, or treated as a separate category.    (1) Exclude those responses from analysis, or (2) follow up with those students to get complete data.    The best approach depends on how much data is missing and why. If only a few students didn't respond, you might exclude those responses or follow up to get complete information. If many students skipped the question, you need to consider whether the question was unclear or too personal. Don't guess or make up missing data—that creates false information.    "

Think about the questions from Module 1 about understanding the story behind data.    Who collected this data, when, how, and why?    Before analyzing any dataset, students should understand its context: Who collected it? When was it collected? How was it collected? Why was it collected? This helps them understand potential limitations, biases, or appropriate uses of the data. For example, data about school lunch preferences collected in 2015 might not reflect current preferences.      You find a dataset that would be perfect for your students' investigation, but it has 50 variables and 1,000 rows. How could you make this manageable for classroom use?    Consider what parts of the dataset are most relevant to your students' questions.    Select only the most relevant variables and a representative sample of rows.    You could: (1) Choose 3-5 variables that directly relate to your students' questions, (2) Select a random sample of 50-100 rows, or (3) Focus on data from a specific time period or geographic area that's relevant to your students.

  "body": " Understanding Data Complexity and Quality  As students become more sophisticated in their data work, they need to understand that not all datasets are created equal. Some are clean and well-organized, others are messy and complex. Learning to work with increasing levels of complexity prepares students for real-world data analysis.   Recognizing Data Complexity   Consider these different datasets and their complexity levels.     Dataset A: 25 students, 2 variables (favorite color, grade level), no missing data. What makes this simple data?    Small size, few variables, complete data, clear categories.      Dataset B: 200 students, 8 variables (including some with missing data), collected over 3 different time periods. What makes this more complex?    Larger size, more variables, missing data, time dimension adds complexity.     Students should start with simple, clean datasets and gradually work up to more complex data as their skills develop.     Teaching Students to Assess Data Quality   Questions Students Can Ask About Any Dataset:    Completeness: Are there missing values? How much data is missing?   Consistency: Are similar things recorded in similar ways throughout the dataset?   Accuracy: Do the numbers make sense? Are there obvious errors or outliers?   Relevance: Does this data actually help answer our question?   Timeliness: Is this data recent enough to be useful for our investigation?   Elementary Approach: Use simple checklists and visual inspection to assess data quality as a class.   Secondary Approach: Have students create data quality reports identifying strengths and limitations of their datasets.     Students are using attendance data from their school. They notice that Fridays consistently show lower attendance than other days, but there's no data recorded for several random dates throughout the year. What should they consider about data quality?    Think about what might explain the patterns they're seeing and how missing data might affect their conclusions.    The Friday pattern might be real, but they should investigate the missing dates and consider how that affects their analysis.    Students should: (1) Consider whether lower Friday attendance reflects a real pattern or data collection issues, (2) Investigate why certain dates are missing (holidays? technical problems? weather closures?), (3) Decide whether to exclude incomplete weeks from analysis, and (4) Consider how missing data might bias their conclusions about attendance patterns.     Think about your students' current skill level. What level of data complexity would be appropriate for their next investigation? What support would they need to work with slightly more complex data than they've used before?   "

They notice that Fridays consistently show lower attendance than other days, but there's no data recorded for several random dates throughout the year. What should they consider about data quality?    Think about what might explain the patterns they're seeing and how missing data might affect their conclusions.    The Friday pattern might be real, but they should investigate the missing dates and consider how that affects their analysis.    Students should: (1) Consider whether lower Friday attendance reflects a real pattern or data collection issues, (2) Investigate why certain dates are missing (holidays? technical problems? weather closures?), (3) Decide whether to exclude incomplete weeks from analysis, and (4) Consider how missing data might bias their conclusions about attendance patterns.

  "body": " Putting It All Together: Your Data Creation and Curation Action Plan  You've explored strategies for helping students design investigations, collect data, organize information, and work with existing datasets. Now let's create a practical plan for building these skills in your classroom.   Choose Your Implementation Approach  Consider which approach would work best for your teaching context:   Option 1: Monthly Mini-Investigations - Once per month, spend a week on a simple data collection and analysis project related to your curriculum.   Option 2: Ongoing Data Tracking - Choose one thing to track consistently (weather, lunch participation, reading minutes) and analyze monthly.   Option 3: Curriculum Integration - Build data collection into existing lessons when natural opportunities arise.   Option 4: Student Choice Projects - Let students design and conduct their own investigations based on their interests.     What's the most important factor to consider when choosing how to implement data creation and curation activities?    Think about what approach you can sustain over time while building student skills.    Choose an approach that fits your teaching style and schedule while providing regular practice for students.    The best approach is one you can implement consistently over time. Students need regular practice with data collection and organization to develop these skills. Consider your curriculum demands, available time, and students' developmental level. Start small and build complexity gradually rather than attempting ambitious projects that might overwhelm you or your students.     My Data Creation and Curation Action Plan   Create your specific plan for implementing these strategies in your classroom.    Which implementation approach feels most manageable for you to start with? Why?    What's one specific data collection activity you could try with your students in the next two weeks?    What materials or preparation would you need to make this activity successful?    How will you help students practice data organization skills? What tools will you use?    Remember: The goal is building students' understanding of how data gets from questions to organized information ready for analysis.      Watch this 4-minute video of teachers sharing their favorite data collection activities and implementation tips.    Before moving to the next module, reflect: What aspect of data creation and curation do you think will be most challenging for your students? What aspect are you most excited to try? How does this connect to your existing curriculum?   "

  "body": " What's Next?  Excellent work! You now have strategies to help students move from curiosity (Module 1) to organized, analyzable data (Module 2). These first two modules provide the foundation for all data science work.  In our next module, Analysis and Modeling , we'll explore how to help students make sense of the data they've collected and organized. You'll learn age-appropriate techniques for identifying patterns, making comparisons, and drawing initial conclusions.  Remember: Data creation and curation skills develop over time through practice. Each investigation your students conduct helps them become more sophisticated in their approach to collecting and organizing information.   Estimated time for this module: 45-60 minutes   Next up: Module 3 - Analysis and Modeling (45-60 minutes)   Quick wins to try this week: Choose one simple data collection activity from your action plan and try it with your students. Focus on the planning and organization process!  "
