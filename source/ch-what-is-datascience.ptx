    <title>What is Data Science Education?</title>
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to your journey into data science education! You might be thinking, <q>Data science sounds complicated and technical—what does this have to do with my classroom?</q> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here's the thing: data science education isn't about turning your students into statisticians or computer programmers. It's about giving them the tools to think critically about the information-rich world they live in—and it's happening in your classroom already, whether you realize it or not.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When your students count votes in a class election, graph the weather for a week, or survey their classmates about favorite books—that's data science. When they question whether a commercial's claim is true or notice patterns in their learning—that's data thinking. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This resource will help you recognize these moments and intentionally build on them, no matter what subject you teach or what grade level you work with. In this short video below, you'll hear Professor Hollylynne Lee of North Calolina State University discuss exactly how students are inundated with data everyday and why it's critical we take our roles in shaping those interactions seriously.

            <em>Watch this 2-minute video from Professor Hollylynne Lee as she explains how students are surrounded by data every day and often use it to inform their decisions without fully understanding where it came from or how it was compiled, which is a major reason why data science education is so important.</em>

        <p>
            Now, before we dive deeper, let's see how data science thinking already connects to different subjects. Each subject area offers natural entry points for developing data skills and thinking habits.

        <exercise xml:id="subject-connections-reflection">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Students are analyzing word frequency in different authors' writing styles. Which subject area does this best fit, and why?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Think about where students would naturally study authors, writing techniques, and literary analysis.

            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    This fits best in English Language Arts because students are analyzing literature and writing techniques. While math skills are involved in counting and comparing, the primary focus is on understanding how different authors use language. This shows how data science enhances rather than replaces traditional ELA instruction.

                    Social Studies provides the best context because this investigation is fundamentally about understanding society and how communities change over time. While students will use math skills to analyze the data and might write about their findings, the core learning objectives align with social studies standards about demographics, community development, and historical change.

                    Let's practice recognizing how data science thinking appears naturally in different subjects, specifically what you teach.

        <p>
            Data science thinking appears across all subject areas because it's about enhancing what you're already teaching with intentional attention to <em>curiosity</em> (asking questions that can be explored with information), <em>critical thinking</em> (questioning sources, recognizing bias, and evaluating claims), <em>problem-solving</em> (using data to understand and address real-world issues), and <em>communication</em> (sharing findings clearly and persuasively). The video below from the Alan Turing Institute features Melissa Terras where she discusses how humanities and data science can work together to address societal issues using examples from her work on handwriting recognition, 3D scanning, and multispectral imaging. While this is certainly beyond the scope of anyone just beginning their data science journey, it certainly highlights how data science can engage students to analyze and solve real world problems.

        <section xml:id="sec-data-science-learning-progressions">
        <title>Introduction to the Data Science Learning Progressions</title>
        <p>
           If you're a math teacher, you're probably already familiar with how the Common Core State Standards describe mathematical progressions—showing how students develop understanding of concepts like number sense or algebraic thinking over multiple grade levels. Science teachers know this approach through the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), which map how scientific thinking develops from kindergarten through high school. Social studies educators have seen similar frameworks in the C3 Framework, which outlines how civic reasoning and inquiry skills build over time.
        </p>
        <p>
        The data science learning progressions work exactly the same way, but with one powerful difference: they're designed to span across all subject areas. Just as the Common Core shows how mathematical reasoning develops, or NGSS shows how scientific thinking evolves, these data science progressions map out how students develop the ability to ask questions about data, think critically about evidence, and communicate findings—skills that are valuable whether students are analyzing historical census data, conducting science experiments, interpreting literature, or solving mathematical problems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Learning progressions are research-based frameworks that map out how students typically develop understanding and skills in a particular area over time. Unlike traditional scope-and-sequence documents that simply list what to teach when, learning progressions describe how student thinking actually evolves. They capture the messy, non-linear reality of how children learn—showing that students don't simply move from "not knowing" to "knowing," but rather develop increasingly sophisticated ways of thinking about concepts over months and years.
        </p>
        <p>
        What makes the data science progressions particularly powerful for your implementation is that they focus on thinking skills rather than specific tools or procedures. Instead of prescribing that students must use particular software or memorize statistical formulas, they describe the reasoning patterns that make someone an effective data scientist: asking good questions, thinking critically about evidence, recognizing bias, communicating findings clearly, and using data responsibly. A second-grader sorting objects by color and a tenth-grader analyzing climate data are both developing the same fundamental data science concepts—just at different levels of complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
        As you begin implementing data science education, these progressions serve as both a planning tool and an assessment guide—just like the standards frameworks you already use. They help you understand what data science thinking looks like at your grade level, identify natural connections to your existing curriculum, and recognize growth in your students even when it doesn't look like traditional academic progress. Most importantly, they give you confidence that you're building genuine data science capabilities in your students, not just teaching them to follow procedures or use specific tools.
        </p>
        <p>
        The progressions also provide a common language for talking about data science education with colleagues, administrators, and parents. When someone asks what students are actually learning in data science, you can point to specific thinking skills and show how they connect to other academic areas and real-world applications—just as you might reference Common Core mathematical practices or NGSS science and engineering practices.
        </p>
        <p>
        Remember, these progressions are meant to support your professional judgment, not replace it. They provide a framework for understanding student development, but you know your students best and can adapt the progressions to meet their specific needs and interests.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data science learning progressions you'll be working with are organized into five interconnected strands. You can explore the complete progressions at <url href="https://www.datasciencelearning.org" visual="Data Science Learning Progressions">the learning progressions website</url>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>1. Data Dispositions and Responsibilities:</em> Developing curiosity, ethics, and critical thinking about data
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>2. Creation and Curation:</em> Collecting, cleaning, and organizing data for analysis
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>3. Analysis and Modeling:</em> Making sense of data through various techniques and tools
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>4. Interpreting Problems and Results:</em> Drawing conclusions and making claims based on evidence
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>5. Visualization and Communication:</em> Sharing data stories effectively with different audiences
        </p>
        
        <p>
            These strands spiral through grade levels, building sophistication over time. A kindergartener sorting objects by color is developing the same fundamental thinking as a high school student analyzing complex datasets—just at different levels of complexity.
        </p>

                    What's the most important thing to understand about how the five data science strands work together?

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The five strands work together in every data science activity. When students do a simple class survey, they're practicing curiosity and ethics (Strand 1), collecting and organizing information (Strand 2), making sense of patterns (Strand 3), drawing conclusions (Strand 4), and sharing results (Strand 5). The complexity increases over time, but even kindergarteners can engage with all five strands in age-appropriate ways.

            <title>Don't Feel Overwhelmed!</title>
            <p>
                You don't need to master all five strands immediately. This resource is designed to help you start where you are and build confidence gradually. Most teachers find that beginning with just one strand—often Data Dispositions and Responsibilities or Visualization and Communication—feels most natural.

            This resource adapts to where you are in your teaching journey. Consider which description best fits your primary teaching context:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Elementary (K-5):</em> I work with younger students who learn best through hands-on activities, concrete examples, and visual representations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Secondary (6-12):</em> I work with older students who can handle more abstract concepts and sophisticated tools like spreadsheets or coding platforms.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Mixed/Other:</em> I work across grade levels, in specialized settings, or want to see examples from multiple levels.
        </p>
        
        <exercise xml:id="pathway-planning">
            <p>
                Based on your teaching context, what type of data science activities do you think would work best with your students? Consider their developmental level, attention span, and interests.
            </p>
        </exercise>
        
        <p>
            Throughout this resource, you'll see examples tailored to different contexts. Elementary teachers will see examples using manipulatives, simple surveys, and picture graphs. Secondary teachers will see examples with spreadsheet tools, data visualization software, and introductory coding. You can always explore examples from other grade bands—data science thinking is remarkably adaptable!

        <exploration xml:id="exploration-quick-survey">
            <title>The Quick Class Survey</title>
            
            <p>
                <em>Time needed:</em> 15 minutes
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Materials:</em> Paper/whiteboard or digital tool of your choice
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>What to do:</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                1. Ask your students a question related to your current topic. Examples: Math: <q>How many pets do you have?</q> Science: <q>What's your favorite weather?</q> Social Studies: <q>How do you get to school?</q> ELA: <q>What's your favorite book genre?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                2. Collect responses quickly (show of hands, exit ticket, etc.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                3. Create a simple visual representation together (tally marks, bar graph, etc.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                4. Ask: <q>What do you notice? What surprises you? What questions does this raise?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                5. Connect back to your lesson: <q>How might this information be useful for...?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Why this works:</em> You've just engaged all five data science strands in 15 minutes! Students practiced questioning (Data Dispositions), collecting information (Creation and Curation), organizing it (Analysis), interpreting results (Interpreting Problems and Results), and communicating findings (Visualization and Communication).

            Let's address some concerns teachers often have about data science education:
        </p>
        
        <exercise xml:id="time-concern">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A teacher says: <q>I don't have time to add another subject to my curriculum.</q> How would you respond to this concern?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Think about whether data science replaces existing content or enhances it.
                </p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Data science thinking enhances what you're already teaching rather than adding new content.
                </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Data science is a way of thinking that makes existing curriculum richer and more engaging. Instead of adding content, it adds depth to current lessons. A math lesson about graphing becomes more meaningful when students graph data they collected about something they care about. A social studies lesson about community becomes more engaging when students analyze real data about their own community.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </exercise>
        
        <exercise xml:id="math-concern">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Another teacher worries: <q>I'm not strong in math, so I can't teach data science.</q> What's the most accurate response?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Consider what skills are most important for data science thinking at the foundational level.
                </p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    The most important data science skills are curiosity, critical thinking, and communication.
                </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    While math becomes more important at higher levels, the foundation of data science is about thinking clearly about information. Many crucial data science concepts don't require advanced math: questioning data sources, recognizing patterns, organizing information, and communicating findings clearly. These are skills that teachers use every day.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </exercise>
        
        <p>
            The key insight: Data science education is about developing ways of thinking that transcend any single subject or mathematical skill level. You're preparing students to be thoughtful consumers and creators of information—a skill they'll need regardless of their career path.

        <p>
            You've taken the first step! In the following modules, we'll dive deeper into each of the five data science strands, always keeping the focus on practical applications you can use immediately.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember: you don't need to become a data scientist to teach data science thinking. You just need to be curious, willing to learn alongside your students, and ready to help them develop the critical thinking skills they'll need for the rest of their lives.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    What's the most important thing to remember as you begin implementing data science education in your classroom?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Think about sustainable change versus trying to do everything at once.
                </p>
            </hint>
            <answer>
                <p>
                    Start small with activities you feel comfortable with and build from there.
                </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Building confidence through small successes creates sustainable change in your teaching practice. You don't need to master all technical tools before starting - simple activities using basic materials work great. The best learning happens when you try things with your students as you learn, so start experimenting right away with activities that feel manageable.
