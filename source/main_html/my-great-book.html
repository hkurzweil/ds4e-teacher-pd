Welcome to your journey into data science education! You might be thinking, Data science sounds complicated and technical—what does this have to do with my classroom?   Here's the thing: data science education isn't about turning your students into statisticians or computer programmers. It's about giving them the tools to think critically about the information-rich world they live in—and it's happening in your classroom already, whether you realize it or not.  When your students count votes in a class election, graph the weather for a week, or survey their classmates about favorite books—that's data science. When they question whether a commercial's claim is true or notice patterns in their learning—that's data thinking.  This resource will help you recognize these moments and intentionally build on them, no matter what subject you teach or what grade level you work with.    Watch this 4-minute video to see data science education in action across different grade levels and subjects.     Data Science is Everywhere (Including Your Classroom)  Before we dive deeper, let's see how data science thinking already connects to different subjects. Each subject area offers natural entry points for developing data skills and thinking habits.    Students are analyzing word frequency in different authors' writing styles. Which subject area does this best fit, and why?    Think about where students would naturally study authors, writing techniques, and literary analysis.    English Language Arts - this connects directly to literary analysis and understanding writing style differences.    This fits best in English Language Arts because students are analyzing literature and writing techniques. While math skills are involved in counting and comparing, the primary focus is on understanding how different authors use language. This shows how data science enhances rather than replaces traditional ELA instruction.      A class wants to use census data to understand how their community has changed over the past 20 years. What subject area provides the best context for this investigation?    Consider which subject focuses on communities, demographics, and change over time.    Social Studies - this investigation focuses on understanding communities, demographics, and historical change.    Social Studies provides the best context because this investigation is fundamentally about understanding society and how communities change over time. While students will use math skills to analyze the data and might write about their findings, the core learning objectives align with social studies standards about demographics, community development, and historical change.     Identifying Data Science Across Subjects   Let's practice recognizing how data science thinking appears naturally in different subjects.     Think of a lesson you've taught recently (or plan to teach). How could you incorporate a simple data collection or analysis activity?    Consider activities like surveying opinions, counting occurrences, comparing quantities, or tracking changes over time.      What questions might students ask as they work with this data? How would you encourage deeper investigation?    Think about follow-up questions like What patterns do you notice? or What surprises you?      Notice how data science thinking can enhance your existing curriculum rather than adding new content!    Data science thinking appears across all subject areas because it's about enhancing what you're already teaching with intentional attention to curiosity (asking questions that can be explored with information), critical thinking (questioning sources, recognizing bias, and evaluating claims), problem-solving (using data to understand and address real-world issues), and communication (sharing findings clearly and persuasively).    This 6-minute video shows how data science naturally fits into everyday teaching across subjects.   The data science learning progressions you'll be working with are organized into five interconnected strands. You can explore the complete progressions at the learning progressions website .   1. Data Dispositions and Responsibilities: Developing curiosity, ethics, and critical thinking about data   2. Creation and Curation: Collecting, cleaning, and organizing data for analysis   3. Analysis and Modeling: Making sense of data through various techniques and tools   4. Interpreting Problems and Results: Drawing conclusions and making claims based on evidence   5. Visualization and Communication: Sharing data stories effectively with different audiences  These strands spiral through grade levels, building sophistication over time. A kindergartener sorting objects by color is developing the same fundamental thinking as a high school student analyzing complex datasets—just at different levels of complexity.    What's the most important thing to understand about how the five data science strands work together?    Think about whether these strands should be taught separately or together, and how they build over time.    The strands are interconnected and should be woven together, building sophistication as students progress through grade levels.    The five strands work together in every data science activity. When students do a simple class survey, they're practicing curiosity and ethics (Strand 1), collecting and organizing information (Strand 2), making sense of patterns (Strand 3), drawing conclusions (Strand 4), and sharing results (Strand 5). The complexity increases over time, but even kindergarteners can engage with all five strands in age-appropriate ways.     Don't Feel Overwhelmed!  You don't need to master all five strands immediately. This resource is designed to help you start where you are and build confidence gradually. Most teachers find that beginning with just one strand—often Data Dispositions and Responsibilities or Visualization and Communication—feels most natural.   This resource adapts to where you are in your teaching journey. Consider which description best fits your primary teaching context:   Elementary (K-5): I work with younger students who learn best through hands-on activities, concrete examples, and visual representations.   Secondary (6-12): I work with older students who can handle more abstract concepts and sophisticated tools like spreadsheets or coding platforms.   Mixed\/Other: I work across grade levels, in specialized settings, or want to see examples from multiple levels.   Based on your teaching context, what type of data science activities do you think would work best with your students? Consider their developmental level, attention span, and interests.   Throughout this resource, you'll see examples tailored to different contexts. Elementary teachers will see examples using manipulatives, simple surveys, and picture graphs. Secondary teachers will see examples with spreadsheet tools, data visualization software, and introductory coding. You can always explore examples from other grade bands—data science thinking is remarkably adaptable!  Let's end this chapter with something you can try in your classroom this week. Here's a simple 15-minute activity that works in any subject and any grade level:   The Quick Class Survey   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: Paper\/whiteboard or digital tool of your choice   What to do:   1. Ask your students a question related to your current topic. Examples: Math: How many pets do you have? Science: What's your favorite weather? Social Studies: How do you get to school? ELA: What's your favorite book genre?   2. Collect responses quickly (show of hands, exit ticket, etc.)  3. Create a simple visual representation together (tally marks, bar graph, etc.)  4. Ask: What do you notice? What surprises you? What questions does this raise?   5. Connect back to your lesson: How might this information be useful for...?    Why this works: You've just engaged all five data science strands in 15 minutes! Students practiced questioning (Data Dispositions), collecting information (Creation and Curation), organizing it (Analysis), interpreting results (Interpreting Problems and Results), and communicating findings (Visualization and Communication).     Watch this 3-minute example of a teacher implementing a quick class survey with 4th graders.     What do you think is the most important part of the Quick Class Survey for developing data science thinking?    Consider which step helps students move beyond just collecting data to actually thinking about what it means.    Asking follow-up questions like What do you notice? and What surprises you?     The follow-up questions are crucial because they develop investigative thinking skills—the heart of data science. While technology and sample size can be important, this activity is about developing thinking habits. The questions help students move from passive data collection to active investigation and analysis.     After You Try It  After trying this activity, consider these questions: What did your students notice that surprised you? What questions did they ask that you hadn't thought of? How might you extend this activity next time? What connections do you see to your curriculum standards?     Building Your Confidence: You're Already a Data Science Teacher  Many teachers feel intimidated by data science because they think it requires advanced mathematical or technical knowledge. The truth is, if you're helping students think critically about information, ask questions, and communicate their findings, you're already teaching data science.   Recognizing Data Science in Your Teaching   Let's identify the data science thinking that's already happening in common classroom activities.     Consider this activity: Students sort objects by color, size, or shape. What data science skills does this develop?    Categorizing and organizing information - foundational data skills      What about: Students create a bar graph showing class favorite foods?     Data visualization and communication skills      And: Students analyze different perspectives on a historical event using multiple sources?     Critical evaluation of evidence and bias recognition     Each of these activities involves data science thinking! The progression shows how concepts naturally build from basic categorization to sophisticated analysis.    Let's address some concerns teachers often have about data science education:    A teacher says: I don't have time to add another subject to my curriculum. How would you respond to this concern?    Think about whether data science replaces existing content or enhances it.    Data science thinking enhances what you're already teaching rather than adding new content.    Data science is a way of thinking that makes existing curriculum richer and more engaging. Instead of adding content, it adds depth to current lessons. A math lesson about graphing becomes more meaningful when students graph data they collected about something they care about. A social studies lesson about community becomes more engaging when students analyze real data about their own community.      Another teacher worries: I'm not strong in math, so I can't teach data science. What's the most accurate response?    Consider what skills are most important for data science thinking at the foundational level.    The most important data science skills are curiosity, critical thinking, and communication.    While math becomes more important at higher levels, the foundation of data science is about thinking clearly about information. Many crucial data science concepts don't require advanced math: questioning data sources, recognizing patterns, organizing information, and communicating findings clearly. These are skills that teachers use every day.    The key insight: Data science education is about developing ways of thinking that transcend any single subject or mathematical skill level. You're preparing students to be thoughtful consumers and creators of information—a skill they'll need regardless of their career path.    What's Next: Your Learning Journey  You've taken the first step! In the following modules, we'll dive deeper into each of the five data science strands, always keeping the focus on practical applications you can use immediately.  Remember: you don't need to become a data scientist to teach data science thinking. You just need to be curious, willing to learn alongside your students, and ready to help them develop the critical thinking skills they'll need for the rest of their lives.    This 5-minute video preview shows what you'll learn in the upcoming modules.     What's the most important thing to remember as you begin implementing data science education in your classroom?    Think about sustainable change versus trying to do everything at once.    Start small with activities you feel comfortable with and build from there.    Building confidence through small successes creates sustainable change in your teaching practice. You don't need to master all technical tools before starting - simple activities using basic materials work great. The best learning happens when you try things with your students as you learn, so start experimenting right away with activities that feel manageable.     What's one specific thing you'll try in your classroom this week based on what you've learned in this chapter?   Ready to continue? In the next module, we'll explore Data Dispositions and Responsibilities —the foundation of all data science thinking.   Estimated time to complete this chapter: 30 minutes   Next up: Module 1 - Data Dispositions and Responsibilities (45-60 minutes)   Quick win to try this week: Implement the Quick Class Survey activity in one of your lessons and notice what questions your students generate!     Module 1: Data Dispositions and Responsibilities   Welcome to the foundation of data science education! This module focuses on developing the right mindset for working with data—both for you and your students.  Data Dispositions and Responsibilities isn't about memorizing definitions or learning technical skills. It's about cultivating curiosity, healthy skepticism, and ethical thinking. These are the habits of mind that make everything else in data science meaningful and responsible.    Watch this 6-minute video to see why data dispositions are the most important foundation for students.   By the end of this module, you'll have practical strategies to help your students ask better questions about the world around them, recognize when data might be biased or incomplete, understand their responsibility when collecting and sharing information about others, and approach problems with an investigative mindset.   Estimated time: 45-60 minutes    Building Data Curiosity and Questioning Skills  Data science begins with curiosity—wondering about the world and asking questions that can be explored through information. But not all questions are data questions. Let's explore what makes a good question for data investigation and how to help students develop this skill.    A student asks, What's the best color? Why wouldn't this make a good data investigation question?    Think about whether this question can be answered objectively through collecting information.    This is purely opinion-based with no objective answer that data could reveal.    While you could survey people about color preferences, there's no objective best color to discover through data. Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information. A better version might be What colors do students in our class prefer for their bedroom walls? This transforms opinion into investigable preferences within a specific population.     The Question Transformation Game   When students ask broad or opinion-based questions, help them reshape their curiosity into something investigable.     A student asks, Why is math hard? How could you transform this into a data question?    Think about making it specific and measurable while honoring the student's curiosity.     What math topics do students in our class find most challenging?       Try another: Why do people like music?     Consider focusing on specific, measurable aspects of music preferences.     What types of music are most popular among students in different grade levels?      The key is transforming general curiosity into specific, measurable questions that students can investigate through data collection.     Try This Week: Curiosity Starters   Time needed: 10 minutes during any lesson   How it works: Use these sentence starters to help students generate data questions related to your current topic.   Elementary (K-5) Starters:  I wonder how many... , Which one is more popular... , Do most kids in our class... , How often does...    Secondary (6-12) Starters:  What factors influence... , How has [topic] changed over time... , What's the relationship between... , Do students who [X] also tend to [Y]...    Example in action: During a lesson on weather (Science), a student uses I wonder how many... to ask I wonder how many rainy days we have each month? Perfect! Now you have a data investigation opportunity.     Watch this 4-minute classroom example of a teacher using question starters with 3rd graders.    Choose a lesson you're planning this week. Write down two question starters that would fit naturally into that lesson and help students generate data questions.   One of the most powerful routines for developing data curiosity is Notice and Wonder. This simple strategy works with any content and naturally leads students toward data thinking.   Try This Week: Notice and Wonder   Time needed: 10 minutes, works with any content   The Strategy: Whenever you present any information to students (a graph, a historical fact, a scientific observation), pause and ask: What do you notice? and What do you wonder?    Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences: Students might notice: Dogs got twice as many votes as cats or Nobody chose fish. Students might wonder: Would this be the same in other classes? or Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?    The magic: This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.   Bonus: Keep a running list of student wonders throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!     Look at this student response: I wonder if lunch preferences change during different seasons. Is this a notice (observation) or a wonder (question for investigation)?    Consider whether this is describing what they see or asking something that could be investigated.    This is a wonder - a question that could lead to further data investigation.    This is definitely a wonder because it poses a question that students could investigate by collecting data across different seasons. Notices would be observations like Pizza got the most votes or There are more boys than girls in this data.  Wonders are the questions that emerge from those observations and lead to new investigations.      Recognizing Bias and Developing Ethical Data Thinking  One of the most important data dispositions is healthy skepticism. Not all data tells the complete story, and students need to develop the habit of asking: What might this data be missing? Who collected this and why? Additionally, when we collect information about people, we have responsibilities.    This 5-minute video explains bias in data collection in kid-friendly terms.   Let's explore bias through a simple scenario that works for any age:   The Playground Survey Problem   The Scenario: Jamie wants to find out what the most popular playground activity is at their school. They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say basketball is their favorite.   Jamie's conclusion:  Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!    What questions should we ask about this conclusion? Where did Jamie conduct the survey? When did they survey? Who did they ask? How did they ask the question? What other information might be helpful?     In the playground survey scenario, what would likely be the MOST significant source of bias?    Think about how the location of data collection might influence the responses.    Jamie probably surveyed students near the basketball court, creating location bias.    Location bias is the biggest issue here. If Jamie surveyed students who were playing basketball or near the basketball court, those students would be much more likely to say basketball is their favorite activity. This shows how WHERE we collect data can significantly influence the results, even with good intentions.      How could Jamie improve their survey to get more reliable results?    Consider ways to make sure all students have an equal chance to participate.    Randomly select students from class lists to survey, rather than surveying based on location.    Random selection from class lists would give every student an equal chance to participate, regardless of which playground activity they prefer. Jamie could also survey at different times and locations, but random selection is the most systematic approach to reducing bias.     Try This Week: Bias Detectives   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: A simple chart, graph, or claim from your curriculum   The Activity: Present any data visualization or claim to your students. Ask them to put on their detective hats and investigate using age-appropriate questions.   Detective Questions for Elementary: Who made this chart? Who did they ask? Who didn't they ask? Does this seem fair?   Detective Questions for Secondary: What was the source of this data? What was the sample size and method? What might be missing from this picture? Who benefits if people believe this claim? What additional information would help us evaluate this?   The goal: Students should become automatically curious about the story behind the data, not just the data itself.     What's the most important thing for students to understand about bias in data?    Think about whether bias is intentional or unintentional, and whether it can be reduced.    Bias is common and often unintentional, but can be reduced by thinking carefully about how data is collected.    Understanding that bias is normal and usually unintentional helps students approach data with healthy skepticism rather than cynicism. Most data collectors aren't trying to mislead—they're just limited by practical constraints. Teaching students to ask good questions about data sources and methods helps them become better consumers and creators of information.    When we collect information about people, we have responsibilities. This is true whether students are surveying classmates about lunch preferences or analyzing historical census data.   Try This Week: Class Data Agreements   Time needed: 20 minutes (one-time setup that lasts all year)  Before any data collection activity, work with your students to create a class agreement about how you'll handle information responsibly.   Elementary Version - Our Data Promise: We will ask before collecting information about each other. We will keep personal information private. We will be kind when sharing what we learn. We will ask for help if we're unsure about something.   Secondary Version - Data Ethics Guidelines: Obtain informed consent before data collection. Anonymize data when sharing results publicly. Consider potential harm or embarrassment to individuals. Be transparent about data collection methods and purpose. Respect the right to withdraw participation.   Pro tip: Refer back to this agreement whenever you do data activities. It becomes a natural part of your classroom culture.     Your class surveys students about how they get to school. One student mentions their family doesn't have a car. What should you do when sharing results with other classes?    Consider how to share useful information while protecting individual privacy.    Share overall patterns without identifying individual responses.    The goal is to protect individual privacy while still sharing useful information about transportation patterns. You could say Most students ride the bus, some walk, and a few get rides without identifying specific students or their family situations. This teaches students to think about the impact of data sharing on real people.     Organizing Ethical Data Practices   Think about the sequence of ethical practices during a classroom data investigation.     What should happen BEFORE students start collecting data?    Explain what information will be collected and how it will be used, then ask for consent.      What should happen DURING data processing?    Remove identifying information before analyzing results.      What should happen WHEN presenting results?    Share findings in ways that protect individual privacy.     Students should also know they can withdraw their data at any time throughout the process.      Developing an Investigative Mindset and Student Data Agency  The best data scientists aren't necessarily the most technical—they're the most curious and persistent. They ask follow-up questions, notice unexpected patterns, and aren't satisfied with surface-level answers. They also see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data.    This 7-minute video shows students developing investigative thinking through a real classroom data project.    The Question Chain Game  This activity helps students develop the habit of asking follow-up questions—the heart of investigation.   How it works: Start with any simple observation or data point from your subject area. Students practice asking But why? and What else could explain this?    Example Chain (Science\/Elementary): Observation: Most kids in our class like sunny days better than rainy days. → But why do they prefer sunny days? → Do kids in places where it rains a lot feel differently? → Do adults feel the same way as kids? → How do people's daily activities change with weather?    Example Chain (Social Studies\/Secondary): Data point: Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years. → What factors contributed to this increase? → How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status? → What were teens doing with that time before social media? → How do we measure the effects of this change?   Notice how each question opens up new possibilities for investigation? This is the investigative mindset in action.     Starting with Students in our class spend an average of 2 hours on homework each night, what would be a good follow-up question to continue an investigative chain?    Think about questions that could lead to further data investigation and comparison.     How does homework time vary by subject or grade level? or similar investigative questions.    Good follow-up questions could include: How does homework time vary by subject? , What factors might explain differences between students? , or How has this changed over time? The key is asking questions that could lead to further data investigation rather than making judgments or stating personal experiences.    Data agency means students see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data. They don't just consume information—they create it, question it, and use it to make their world better.   From Questions to Action  The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:   Step 1: Start with student concerns - What's something about our school\/community\/world that you're curious about or want to change?    Step 2: Help them find the data angle - What information would help us understand this better? Who could we ask? What could we count or measure?    Step 3: Support investigation planning - How will we collect this information fairly? What do we predict we'll find? Who should know about our results?    Step 4: Celebrate their expertise - What did you discover that adults might not know? How could this information help make decisions? What would you want to investigate next?      When a student proposes investigating something they care about, what's the most important thing to do?    Consider how to maintain their ownership while building their skills.    Help them transform their interest into investigable questions.    This maintains their ownership and motivation while building their skills in formulating data questions. Rather than providing pre-existing datasets or changing their topic to something easier, we honor their curiosity and help them develop the tools to investigate what they care about. This builds both skills and confidence.     Real Examples of Student Data Agency   Consider these examples of students using data to make a difference.    Elementary example: Third graders survey classmates about lunch preferences and present findings to cafeteria staff, leading to a new menu option. What data science skills are they developing?    High school example: Students analyze local census data to understand demographic changes in their community and present findings at a town hall meeting. How does this demonstrate data agency?    In both cases, students see their questions as worthy of investigation and their findings as valuable to decision-makers. This is the heart of data agency.      Putting It All Together: Your Data Dispositions Action Plan  You've explored the key components of Data Dispositions and Responsibilities. Now let's create a practical plan for building these habits in your classroom.   Choose Your Weekly Data Dispositions Routine  Pick one routine to try consistently for the next month. Small, regular practices build habits more effectively than occasional big activities.   Option 1: Monday Question Starters - Every Monday, spend 5 minutes helping students generate data questions about your upcoming week's content using the sentence starters from this module.   Option 2: Wonder Wednesday - Every Wednesday, present one piece of information (graph, fact, image) and ask What do you notice? What do you wonder?    Option 3: Bias Detective Friday - Every Friday, spend 10 minutes examining a claim or data source with your detective questions from this module.   Option 4: Create Your Own - Design a routine that fits your teaching style and subject area, incorporating the key elements of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking.     What's the most important factor in choosing which data dispositions routine to implement in your classroom?    Think about sustainability versus ambition.    Choose the one you can realistically do consistently.    Regular practice builds habits better than ambitious routines that fizzle out after a few weeks. The most important factor is finding something you can sustain that builds student thinking skills. Start small and build from there—consistency matters more than coverage.     My Data Dispositions Action Plan   Create your personal plan for implementing data dispositions in your classroom.    Which routine from the options above feels most manageable for you to try for the next month? Why?    What's one specific lesson this week where you could try the Notice and Wonder routine?    How will you remember to implement your chosen routine consistently? (Set a phone reminder? Write it in your lesson plans? Partner with a colleague?)    Remember: You're building lifelong thinking habits, not just teaching data science content. Every small step matters!      Watch this 3-minute video to see teachers sharing their experiences implementing data dispositions routines.    Before moving to the next module, reflect: Which concept from this module feels most important for your students? What questions do you have about building data dispositions in your specific teaching context?     What's Next?  Congratulations! You've built the foundation for all data science education. The habits of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking you develop through Data Dispositions and Responsibilities will support everything else your students do with data.  In our next module, Creation and Curation , we'll explore how to help students collect, organize, and clean data for investigation. You'll learn practical strategies for everything from student surveys to using existing datasets.  Remember: Data dispositions aren't something you teach once and move on. These are ongoing practices that deepen throughout the year and across all subject areas.   Estimated time for this module: 45-60 minutes   Next up: Module 2 - Creation and Curation (45-60 minutes)   Quick wins to try this week: Choose one routine from your action plan and implement it for three days. Notice what questions your students generate!      Backmatter       This book was authored in PreTeXt .    "

Think about questions that could lead to further data investigation and comparison.     How does homework time vary by subject or grade level? or similar investigative questions.    Good follow-up questions could include: How does homework time vary by subject? , What factors might explain differences between students? , or How has this changed over time? The key is asking questions that could lead to further data investigation rather than making judgments or stating personal experiences.   "

  "body": " From Questions to Action  The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:   Step 1: Start with student concerns - What's something about our school\/community\/world that you're curious about or want to change?    Step 2: Help them find the data angle - What information would help us understand this better? Who could we ask? What could we count or measure?    Step 3: Support investigation planning - How will we collect this information fairly? What do we predict we'll find? Who should know about our results?    Step 4: Celebrate their expertise - What did you discover that adults might not know? How could this information help make decisions? What would you want to investigate next?   "

Help them transform their interest into investigable questions.    This maintains their ownership and motivation while building their skills in formulating data questions. Rather than providing pre-existing datasets or changing their topic to something easier, we honor their curiosity and help them develop the tools to investigate what they care about. This builds both skills and confidence.   "

  "body": " Real Examples of Student Data Agency   Consider these examples of students using data to make a difference.    Elementary example: Third graders survey classmates about lunch preferences and present findings to cafeteria staff, leading to a new menu option. What data science skills are they developing?    High school example: Students analyze local census data to understand demographic changes in their community and present findings at a town hall meeting. How does this demonstrate data agency?    In both cases, students see their questions as worthy of investigation and their findings as valuable to decision-makers. This is the heart of data agency.   "

Option 2: Wonder Wednesday - Every Wednesday, present one piece of information (graph, fact, image) and ask What do you notice? What do you wonder?    Option 3: Bias Detective Friday - Every Friday, spend 10 minutes examining a claim or data source with your detective questions from this module.   Option 4: Create Your Own - Design a routine that fits your teaching style and subject area, incorporating the key elements of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking.  "
