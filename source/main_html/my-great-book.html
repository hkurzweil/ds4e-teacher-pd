  "body": " Educator Professional Development  Onboarding to the Data Science Learning Progressions     Hannah Kurzweil Data Science 4 Everyone Data Science Learning Progressions PD      My Website   copyright            What is Data Science Education?   Welcome to your journey into data science education! You might be thinking, Data science sounds complicated and technical—what does this have to do with my classroom?   Here's the thing: data science education isn't about turning your students into statisticians or computer programmers. It's about giving them the tools to think critically about the information-rich world they live in—and it's happening in your classroom already, whether you realize it or not.  When your students count votes in a class election, graph the weather for a week, or survey their classmates about favorite books—that's data science. When they question whether a commercial's claim is true or notice patterns in their learning—that's data thinking.  This resource will help you recognize these moments and intentionally build on them, no matter what subject you teach or what grade level you work with.    Data Science is Everywhere (Including Your Classroom)  Before we dive deeper, let's see how data science thinking already connects to different subjects. Each subject area offers natural entry points for developing data skills and thinking habits.   Connect Data Science to Your Subject  Below are some data science concepts and classroom scenarios. Think about how each concept might naturally fit in different subject areas. Don't worry about getting it right —there are often multiple correct connections!   Consider these examples:    Analyzing word frequency in different authors' writing styles - This naturally fits in English Language Arts where students study literature and writing techniques.   Using census data to understand community changes over time - This connects well to Social Studies where students explore demographics and historical change.   Collecting and analyzing experimental data - This is a natural fit for Science classes where students conduct investigations.   Creating graphs and charts to represent information - This works well in Mathematics where students learn about data representation.  Notice how data science thinking appears across all subject areas? Each brings its own perspective and natural entry points for data exploration.   Notice how data science thinking appears across all subject areas? That's because data science education isn't about adding another subject to your already-packed curriculum. It's about enhancing what you're already teaching with intentional attention to:   Curiosity: Asking questions that can be explored with information   Critical thinking: Questioning sources, recognizing bias, and evaluating claims   Problem-solving: Using data to understand and address real-world issues   Communication: Sharing findings clearly and persuasively    Your Roadmap: The Data Science Learning Progressions  The data science learning progressions you'll be working with are organized into five interconnected strands:   1. Data Dispositions and Responsibilities: Developing curiosity, ethics, and critical thinking about data   2. Creation and Curation: Collecting, cleaning, and organizing data for analysis   3. Analysis and Modeling: Making sense of data through various techniques and tools   4. Interpreting Problems and Results: Drawing conclusions and making claims based on evidence   5. Visualization and Communication: Sharing data stories effectively with different audiences  These strands spiral through grade levels, building sophistication over time. A kindergartener sorting objects by color is developing the same fundamental thinking as a high school student analyzing complex datasets—just at different levels of complexity.   Don't Feel Overwhelmed!  You don't need to master all five strands immediately. This resource is designed to help you start where you are and build confidence gradually. Most teachers find that beginning with just one strand—often Data Dispositions and Responsibilities or Visualization and Communication—feels most natural.     Choose Your Adventure  This resource adapts to where you are in your teaching journey. Before we continue, let's help you choose the pathway that will be most useful for you.   Choose Your Teaching Context  This resource adapts to where you are in your teaching journey. Consider which option best describes your primary teaching context:   Elementary (K-5): I work with younger students who learn best through hands-on activities, concrete examples, and visual representations.   Secondary (6-12): I work with older students who can handle more abstract concepts and sophisticated tools like spreadsheets or coding platforms.   Mixed\/Other: I work across grade levels, in specialized settings, or want to see examples from multiple levels.  No matter which pathway fits you best, you'll see examples tailored to your context throughout this resource.   Here's what you can expect based on your teaching context:   Elementary teachers will see examples using manipulatives, simple surveys, picture graphs, and activities that connect to students' immediate experiences.   Secondary teachers will see examples with spreadsheet tools, data visualization software, and introductory coding that prepare students for college and careers.   Mixed\/Other will see examples from across grade bands to understand how data science thinking develops over time.  Based on your selection, the examples and activities throughout this resource will be tailored to your context. You can always change this later or explore examples from other grade bands—data science thinking is remarkably adaptable!    Your First Data Science Moment  Let's end this chapter with something you can try in your classroom this week. Here's a simple 15-minute activity that works in any subject and any grade level:   The Quick Class Survey   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: Paper\/whiteboard or digital tool of your choice   What to do:   1. Ask your students a question related to your current topic. Examples: Math: How many pets do you have? Science: What's your favorite weather? Social Studies: How do you get to school? ELA: What's your favorite book genre?   2. Collect responses quickly (show of hands, exit ticket, etc.)  3. Create a simple visual representation together (tally marks, bar graph, etc.)  4. Ask: What do you notice? What surprises you? What questions does this raise?   5. Connect back to your lesson: How might this information be useful for...?    Why this works: You've just engaged all five data science strands in 15 minutes! Students practiced questioning (Data Dispositions), collecting information (Creation and Curation), organizing it (Analysis), interpreting results (Interpreting Problems and Results), and communicating findings (Visualization and Communication).    After You Try It  After trying this activity, consider these questions:  What did your students notice that surprised you? What questions did they ask that you hadn't thought of? How might you extend this activity next time? What connections do you see to your curriculum standards?     What's Next?  You've taken the first step! In the following modules, we'll dive deeper into each of the five data science strands, always keeping the focus on practical applications you can use immediately.  Remember: you don't need to become a data scientist to teach data science thinking. You just need to be curious, willing to learn alongside your students, and ready to help them develop the critical thinking skills they'll need for the rest of their lives.  Ready to continue? In the next module, we'll explore Data Dispositions and Responsibilities —the foundation of all data science thinking.   Estimated time to complete this chapter: 30 minutes   Next up: Module 1 - Data Dispositions and Responsibilities (45-60 minutes)     Module 1: Data Dispositions and Responsibilities   Welcome to the foundation of data science education! This module focuses on developing the right mindset for working with data—both for you and your students.  Data Dispositions and Responsibilities isn't about memorizing definitions or learning technical skills. It's about cultivating curiosity, healthy skepticism, and ethical thinking. These are the habits of mind that make everything else in data science meaningful and responsible.  By the end of this module, you'll have practical strategies to help your students:  Ask better questions about the world around them  Recognize when data might be biased or incomplete  Understand their responsibility when collecting and sharing information about others  Approach problems with an investigative mindset   Estimated time: 45-60 minutes    Building Data Curiosity  Data science begins with curiosity—wondering about the world and asking questions that can be explored through information. But not all questions are data questions. Let's explore what makes a good question for data investigation.   What Makes a Good Data Question?  Consider these questions a student might ask. Which ones could be explored through collecting and analyzing information?   Question 1:  What's the best color?   This is an opinion question. While we could survey people about favorite colors, there's no objective best color.   Question 2:  Do students in our school prefer summer or winter?   This is a great data question! We could survey students and analyze the results to find patterns.   Question 3:  Why do people like music?   This is too broad and philosophical. We might refine it to What types of music are most popular among teenagers?    Question 4:  Has the weather in our town changed over the past 10 years?   Excellent data question! We could gather weather data and look for trends over time.  Notice the pattern? Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information.    Teaching Tip: The Question Transformation Game  When students ask broad or opinion-based questions, don't shut them down! Instead, play the Question Transformation Game. Help them reshape their curiosity into something investigable.  Student asks: Why is math hard?   You might transform it to: What math topics do students in our class find most challenging? or How much time do students spend on math homework compared to other subjects?     Try This Week: Curiosity Starters   Time needed: 10 minutes during any lesson   How it works: Use these sentence starters to help students generate data questions related to your current topic.   Elementary (K-5) Starters:    I wonder how many...    Which one is more popular...    Do most kids in our class...    How often does...    Secondary (6-12) Starters:    What factors influence...    How has [topic] changed over time...    What's the relationship between...    Do students who [X] also tend to [Y]...    Example in action: During a lesson on weather (Science), a student uses I wonder how many... to ask I wonder how many rainy days we have each month? Perfect! Now you have a data investigation opportunity.     Recognizing Bias and Incomplete Information  One of the most important data dispositions is healthy skepticism. Not all data tells the complete story, and students need to develop the habit of asking: What might this data be missing? Who collected this and why?    The Playground Survey Problem  Let's explore bias through a simple scenario that works for any age:   The Scenario: Jamie wants to find out what the most popular playground activity is at their school. They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say basketball is their favorite.   Jamie's conclusion:  Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!    What questions should we ask about this conclusion?   Where did Jamie conduct the survey? (If it was near the basketball court, that might bias the results)  When did they survey? (Maybe other activities happen at different times)  Who did they ask? (Were they all the same age? Same friend group?)  How did they ask the question? (Did they list options or let students answer freely?)  What other information might be helpful? (How many total students are at the school? What activities are available?)   This scenario teaches students that data can be influenced by:   Where and when information is collected   Who is asked (and who isn't asked)   How questions are worded   Why someone is collecting the information   Age-Appropriate Bias Discussions   Elementary: Focus on fairness. Is this fair? Did everyone get a chance to share their opinion?    Middle School: Introduce the word bias and connect to their sense of justice. Whose voices might be missing from this data?    High School: Explore systemic bias and historical examples. How might the way this data was collected affect communities differently?     Try This Week: Bias Detectives   Time needed: 15 minutes   Materials: A simple chart, graph, or claim from your curriculum (textbook, news article appropriate for your grade level, or student-generated data)   The Activity: Present any data visualization or claim to your students. Ask them to put on their detective hats and investigate:   Detective Questions for Elementary:   Who made this chart?  Who did they ask?  Who didn't they ask?  Does this seem fair?   Detective Questions for Secondary:   What was the source of this data?  What was the sample size and method?  What might be missing from this picture?  Who benefits if people believe this claim?  What additional information would help us evaluate this?   The goal: Students should become automatically curious about the story behind the data, not just the data itself.     Understanding Our Responsibility with Data  When we collect information about people, we have responsibilities. This is true whether students are surveying classmates about lunch preferences or analyzing historical census data. Building ethical thinking early sets the foundation for responsible data practices throughout life.   Would You Share This Information?  Present these scenarios to help students think about privacy and consent:   Scenario 1: Your class surveys students about their favorite subjects. Is it okay to share individual student answers with the principal?  Discussion point: How can we share what we learned without identifying specific students?   Scenario 2: You're collecting data about how students get to school. One student mentions their family doesn't have a car. Should this information be included in your presentation to other classes?  Discussion point: How might this information affect that student? What's our responsibility?   Scenario 3: Students want to survey classmates about their weekend activities. What questions would be appropriate? What questions might be too personal?  Discussion point: How do we decide what's okay to ask about?   Key principles to emphasize:   Ask permission before collecting personal information  Protect individual privacy when sharing results  Consider how our questions might affect others  Be honest about how information will be used    Try This Week: Class Data Agreements   Time needed: 20 minutes (one-time setup that lasts all year)  Before any data collection activity, work with your students to create a class agreement about how you'll handle information responsibly.   Elementary Version - Our Data Promise:   We will ask before collecting information about each other  We will keep personal information private  We will be kind when sharing what we learn  We will ask for help if we're unsure about something   Secondary Version - Data Ethics Guidelines:   Obtain informed consent before data collection  Anonymize data when sharing results publicly  Consider potential harm or embarrassment to individuals  Be transparent about data collection methods and purpose  Respect the right to withdraw participation   Pro tip: Refer back to this agreement whenever you do data activities. It becomes a natural part of your classroom culture.     Developing an Investigative Mindset  The best data scientists aren't necessarily the most technical—they're the most curious and persistent. They ask follow-up questions, notice unexpected patterns, and aren't satisfied with surface-level answers.   The Question Chain Game  This activity helps students develop the habit of asking follow-up questions—the heart of investigation.   How it works: Start with any simple observation or data point from your subject area. Students practice asking But why? and What else could explain this?    Example Chain (Science\/Elementary):   Observation: Most kids in our class like sunny days better than rainy days.   Follow-up question: But why do they prefer sunny days?   New question: Do kids in places where it rains a lot feel differently?   New question: Do adults feel the same way as kids?   New question: How do people's daily activities change with weather?    Example Chain (Social Studies\/Secondary):   Data point: Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years.   Follow-up: What factors contributed to this increase?   New question: How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status?   New question: What were teens doing with that time before social media?   New question: How do we measure the effects of this change?   Notice how each question opens up new possibilities for investigation? This is the investigative mindset in action.    Try This Week: Notice and Wonder   Time needed: 10 minutes, works with any content   The Strategy: Whenever you present any information to students (a graph, a historical fact, a scientific observation), pause and ask:   What do you notice?    What do you wonder?    Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences:   Students might notice: Dogs got twice as many votes as cats or Nobody chose fish   Students might wonder: Would this be the same in other classes? or Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?    The magic: This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.   Bonus: Keep a running list of student wonders throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!     Building Student Data Agency  Data agency means students see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data. They don't just consume information—they create it, question it, and use it to make their world better.   From Questions to Action  The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:   Step 1: Start with student concerns    What's something about our school\/community\/world that you're curious about or want to change?    Step 2: Help them find the data angle    What information would help us understand this better?    Who could we ask?    What could we count or measure?    Step 3: Support investigation planning    How will we collect this information fairly?    What do we predict we'll find?    Who should know about our results?    Step 4: Celebrate their expertise    What did you discover that adults might not know?    How could this information help make decisions?    What would you want to investigate next?     Real Examples of Student Data Agency   Elementary: Third graders survey classmates about lunch preferences and present findings to cafeteria staff, leading to a new menu option.   Middle School: Students investigate whether the school's recycling program is working by tracking waste data and propose improvements to the principal.   High School: Students analyze local census data to understand demographic changes in their community and present findings at a town hall meeting.  The key: Students see their questions as worthy of investigation and their findings as valuable to decision-makers.     Putting It All Together: Your Data Dispositions Action Plan  You've explored the key components of Data Dispositions and Responsibilities. Now let's create a practical plan for building these habits in your classroom.   Choose Your Weekly Data Dispositions Routine  Pick one routine to try consistently for the next month. Small, regular practices build habits more effectively than occasional big activities.   Option 1: Monday Question Starters   Every Monday, spend 5 minutes helping students generate data questions about your upcoming week's content using the sentence starters from this module.   Option 2: Wonder Wednesday   Every Wednesday, present one piece of information (graph, fact, image) and ask What do you notice? What do you wonder?    Option 3: Bias Detective Friday   Every Friday, spend 10 minutes examining a claim or data source with your detective questions from this module.   Option 4: Create Your Own   Design a routine that fits your teaching style and subject area, incorporating the key elements of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking.    Reflection: Your Data Dispositions Growth  Before moving to the next module, consider:  Which concept from this module feels most important for your students? Which activity are you most excited to try? What questions do you have about building data dispositions in your specific teaching context? How might these practices connect to your existing curriculum standards?     What's Next?  Congratulations! You've built the foundation for all data science education. The habits of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking you develop through Data Dispositions and Responsibilities will support everything else your students do with data.  In our next module, Creation and Curation , we'll explore how to help students collect, organize, and clean data for investigation. You'll learn practical strategies for everything from student surveys to using existing datasets.  Remember: Data dispositions aren't something you teach once and move on. These are ongoing practices that deepen throughout the year and across all subject areas.   Estimated time for this module: 45-60 minutes   Next up: Module 2 - Creation and Curation (45-60 minutes)   Quick wins to try this week: Choose one routine from your action plan and implement it for three days. Notice what questions your students generate!      Backmatter       This book was authored in PreTeXt .    "

Question 2:  Do students in our school prefer summer or winter?   This is a great data question! We could survey students and analyze the results to find patterns.   Question 3:  Why do people like music?   This is too broad and philosophical. We might refine it to What types of music are most popular among teenagers?    Question 4:  Has the weather in our town changed over the past 10 years?   Excellent data question! We could gather weather data and look for trends over time.  Notice the pattern? Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information.  "

They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say basketball is their favorite.   Jamie's conclusion:  Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!    What questions should we ask about this conclusion?   Where did Jamie conduct the survey? (If it was near the basketball court, that might bias the results)  When did they survey? (Maybe other activities happen at different times)  Who did they ask? (Were they all the same age? Same friend group?)  How did they ask the question? (Did they list options or let students answer freely?)  What other information might be helpful? (How many total students are at the school? What activities are available?)  "

How it works: Start with any simple observation or data point from your subject area. Students practice asking But why? and What else could explain this?    Example Chain (Science\/Elementary):   Observation: Most kids in our class like sunny days better than rainy days.   Follow-up question: But why do they prefer sunny days?   New question: Do kids in places where it rains a lot feel differently?   New question: Do adults feel the same way as kids?   New question: How do people's daily activities change with weather?    Example Chain (Social Studies\/Secondary):   Data point: Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years.   Follow-up: What factors contributed to this increase?   New question: How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status?   New question: What were teens doing with that time before social media?   New question: How do we measure the effects of this change?   Notice how each question opens up new possibilities for investigation? This is the investigative mindset in action.  "

What do you wonder?    Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences:   Students might notice: Dogs got twice as many votes as cats or Nobody chose fish   Students might wonder: Would this be the same in other classes? or Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?    The magic: This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.   Bonus: Keep a running list of student wonders throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!  "
