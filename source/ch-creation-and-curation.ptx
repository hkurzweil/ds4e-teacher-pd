    <title>Module 2: Getting Data Ready - Creation and Curation</title>
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to the hands-on world of data collection and organization! This module focuses on where data comes from and how to make it useful for investigation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Creation and Curation isn't about turning your students into professional researchers. It's about helping them understand that data doesn't just appear—it's collected by people making decisions about what to measure and how. Whether students are conducting their own surveys or using existing datasets, they need to understand how data gets from the messy real world into organized, analyzable formats.

            By the end of this module, you'll have practical strategies to help your students design simple investigations, collect data responsibly, organize information effectively, and understand the difference between clean and messy datasets.

        <title>From Questions to Data Collection: Designing Simple Investigations</title>
        
        <p>
            Once students have developed good data questions (from Module 1), they need to learn how to collect information to answer those questions. The design of a data investigation is just as important as the analysis—poor collection methods lead to unreliable conclusions.

                    A student wants to investigate: <q>Do students in our school prefer summer or winter activities?</q> What's the first step in designing this investigation?
                </p>

                    Think about what specific information they would need to collect to answer this question.
                </p>

            <answer>
                <p>
                    Define what they mean by <q>summer activities</q> and <q>winter activities</q> and decide who they'll ask.
                </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Before collecting any data, students need to be specific about their terms. What counts as a summer activity? Are we talking about outdoor vs. indoor activities, or activities that can only be done in certain seasons? Who will they survey—the whole school, certain grades, or their class? These planning decisions directly affect what conclusions they can draw from their data.

                <em>How it works:</em> Walk students through designing a simple investigation using this framework:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>1. Clarify the Question:</em> What exactly are we trying to find out? What do key terms mean?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>2. Define the Population:</em> Who will we ask? Everyone in the class? School? Grade level?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>3. Plan Data Collection:</em> How will we ask the question? When? Where?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>4. Consider Ethics:</em> Is this information private? Do we need permission?

                <em>5. Plan Organization:</em> How will we record and organize responses?

                <em>Elementary Example:</em> <q>What's the most popular lunch food in our class?</q> → Define <q>lunch food</q> (main dish? including sides?), survey all classmates, use tally marks to record responses.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Secondary Example:</em> <q>How do study habits vary by grade level?</q> → Define <q>study habits</q> (time spent? location? methods?), survey students from different grades, use a simple form to record multiple pieces of information.

        <title>Data Collection in Practice: Student Surveys and Observations</title>
        
        <p>
            The most common way students collect data is through surveys and simple observations. While these seem straightforward, there are important considerations that affect the quality and usefulness of the data.
        </p>
        
        <exploration xml:id="exploration-student-surveys">
            <title>Try This Week: Student Survey Basics</title>
            
            <p>
                <em>Materials:</em> Paper or simple digital survey tool
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Steps for Success:</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>1. Write Clear Questions:</em> Avoid yes/no questions when you want more information. Instead of <q>Do you like reading?</q> try <q>How many books do you read per month?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>2. Consider Question Order:</em> Start with easy, non-personal questions. Save sensitive topics for later if needed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>3. Test Your Questions:</em> Try the survey with a few students first. Are the questions clear? Do students understand what you're asking?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>4. Plan for Different Responses:</em> What if someone doesn't know? What if they have multiple answers? Plan for these situations.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>5. Make Recording Easy:</em> Use simple forms, clear handwriting, or digital tools that work reliably.

                <p>
                    <q>How many days per week do you exercise for at least 20 minutes?</q> is much better because it defines what counts as exercise (20+ minutes) and gives you a number you can compare across students. <q>Do you exercise?</q> is too vague—everyone might have different ideas about what <q>exercise</q> means, leading to responses that can't be meaningfully compared.

            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Observation works well for things like: counting how many students choose different lunch options, measuring plant growth, timing how long different activities take, or recording weather conditions. Surveys are better for opinions, preferences, experiences, or information that isn't directly observable (like how students feel about a topic or what they do at home).

                    The best approach depends on how much data is missing and why. If only a few students didn't respond, you might exclude those responses or follow up to get complete information. If many students skipped the question, you need to consider whether the question was unclear or too personal. Don't guess or make up missing data—that creates false information.

This helps them understand potential limitations, biases, or appropriate uses of the data. For example, data about school lunch preferences collected in 2015 might not reflect current preferences.

            <p>
                Before moving to the next module, reflect: What aspect of data creation and curation do you think will be most challenging for your students? What aspect are you most excited to try? How does this connect to your existing curriculum?

        <p>
            Excellent work! You now have strategies to help students move from curiosity (Module 1) to organized, analyzable data (Module 2). These first two modules provide the foundation for all data science work.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In our next module, <em>Analysis and Modeling</em>, we'll explore how to help students make sense of the data they've collected and organized. You'll learn age-appropriate techniques for identifying patterns, making comparisons, and drawing initial conclusions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember: Data creation and curation skills develop over time through practice. Each investigation your students conduct helps them become more sophisticated in their approach to collecting and organizing information.

            <em>Next up:</em> Module 3 - Analysis and Modeling (45-60 minutes)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Quick wins to try this week:</em> Choose one simple data collection activity from your action plan and try it with your students. Focus on the planning and organization process!
