    <title>Module 7: Building Your Data Science Toolkit</title>
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to your data science toolkit development! This module focuses on building a sustainable collection of tools, resources, and datasets that will support your data science teaching for years to come.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Building Your Data Science Toolkit isn't about mastering every available technology or collecting hundreds of datasets. It's about strategically selecting tools and resources that match your teaching style, your students' needs, and your comfort level, then gradually expanding your capabilities over time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By the end of this module, you'll have a curated collection of tools appropriate for your context, vetted datasets ready to use with students, a systematic approach to evaluating new resources, and a plan for gradually expanding your toolkit as your confidence grows.

        <title>Choosing the Right Tools for Your Context</title>
        
        <p>
            The best data science tools for your classroom are the ones you'll actually use consistently. This means considering not just what's most powerful or popular, but what fits your technology environment, your comfort level, and your students' needs.

                    When choosing data science tools for your classroom, what should be your primary consideration?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Think about sustainability and consistent use rather than getting the most advanced options.
                </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The best tool is the one that works reliably in your specific context. A simple tool you can use confidently every week is infinitely better than a sophisticated tool that intimidates you or constantly has technical problems. Consider your device availability, internet reliability, student tech skills, and your own comfort level before choosing tools.

            </p>
            <p>
                • Do you need tools for data collection, analysis, visualization, or all three?
            </p>
            <p>
                • Will you work primarily with data you create or datasets that already exist?

            <p>
                • How important is it that students can access tools from home?

            </p>
            <p>
                • Are you comfortable learning alongside your students, or do you prefer to master tools first?

                    Tool mastery should follow a progression: start with tools that work reliably in your environment and match your current skill level. Once you're comfortable using these consistently, identify one new tool per semester or year to explore. This prevents overwhelm while ensuring steady growth in your capabilities.

            <p>
                <em>Option 1: Minimalist Approach</em> - Start with 1-2 tools you can master completely before adding anything new. Focus on paper-based backups and simple digital tools.
