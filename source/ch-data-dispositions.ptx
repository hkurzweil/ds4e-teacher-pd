    <title>Module 1: Data Dispositions and Responsibilities</title>
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to the foundation of data science education! This module focuses on developing the right <em>mindset</em> for working with data—both for you and your students.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Data Dispositions and Responsibilities isn't about memorizing definitions or learning technical skills. It's about cultivating curiosity, healthy skepticism, and ethical thinking. These are the habits of mind that make everything else in data science meaningful and responsible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By the end of this module, you'll have practical strategies to help your students:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ask better questions about the world around them
        </p>
        <p>
            Recognize when data might be biased or incomplete
        </p>
        <p>
            Understand their responsibility when collecting and sharing information about others
        </p>
        <p>
            Approach problems with an investigative mindset
        </p>

        <title>Building Data Curiosity</title>
        
        <p>
            Data science begins with curiosity—wondering about the world and asking questions that can be explored through information. But not all questions are <q>data questions.</q> Let's explore what makes a good question for data investigation.
        </p>
        
        <exploration xml:id="exploration-good-questions">
            <title>What Makes a Good Data Question?</title>
            
            <p>
                Consider these questions a student might ask. Which ones could be explored through collecting and analyzing information?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Question 1:</em> <q>What's the best color?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an opinion question. While we could survey people about favorite colors, there's no objective <q>best</q> color.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Question 2:</em> <q>Do students in our school prefer summer or winter?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a great data question! We could survey students and analyze the results to find patterns.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Question 3:</em> <q>Why do people like music?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is too broad and philosophical. We might refine it to <q>What types of music are most popular among teenagers?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Question 4:</em> <q>Has the weather in our town changed over the past 10 years?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Excellent data question! We could gather weather data and look for trends over time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notice the pattern? Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information.

            <title>Teaching Tip: The Question Transformation Game</title>
            <p>
                When students ask broad or opinion-based questions, don't shut them down! Instead, play the <q>Question Transformation Game.</q> Help them reshape their curiosity into something investigable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Student asks: <q>Why is math hard?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                You might transform it to: <q>What math topics do students in our class find most challenging?</q> or <q>How much time do students spend on math homework compared to other subjects?</q>

        <title>Recognizing Bias and Incomplete Information</title>
        
        <p>
            One of the most important data dispositions is healthy skepticism. Not all data tells the complete story, and students need to develop the habit of asking: <q>What might this data be missing? Who collected this and why?</q>

            <title>The Playground Survey Problem</title>
            
            <p>
                Let's explore bias through a simple scenario that works for any age:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Scenario:</em> Jamie wants to find out what the most popular playground activity is at their school. They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say <q>basketball</q> is their favorite.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Jamie's conclusion:</em> <q>Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>What questions should we ask about this conclusion?</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Where did Jamie conduct the survey? (If it was near the basketball court, that might bias the results)
            </p>
            <p>
                When did they survey? (Maybe other activities happen at different times)
            </p>
            <p>
                Who did they ask? (Were they all the same age? Same friend group?)
            </p>
            <p>
                How did they ask the question? (Did they list options or let students answer freely?)
            </p>
            <p>
                What other information might be helpful? (How many total students are at the school? What activities are available?)
            </p>
        </exploration>
        
        <p>
            This scenario teaches students that data can be influenced by:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Where and when</em> information is collected
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Who</em> is asked (and who isn't asked)

                <em>Example Chain (Social Studies/Secondary):</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Data point: <q>Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Follow-up: <q>What factors contributed to this increase?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                New question: <q>How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                New question: <q>What were teens doing with that time before social media?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                New question: <q>How do we measure the effects of this change?</q>

            <title>Try This Week: Notice and Wonder</title>
            
            <p>
                <em>Time needed:</em> 10 minutes, works with any content
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Strategy:</em> Whenever you present any information to students (a graph, a historical fact, a scientific observation), pause and ask:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <q>What do you notice?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What do you wonder?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences:</em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Students might notice: <q>Dogs got twice as many votes as cats</q> or <q>Nobody chose fish</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Students might wonder: <q>Would this be the same in other classes?</q> or <q>Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>The magic:</em> This simple routine develops the habit of looking beyond surface information to ask deeper questions. It works in any subject with any type of information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Bonus:</em> Keep a running list of student <q>wonders</q> throughout the year. These become potential data investigation topics!

        <title>Building Student Data Agency</title>
        
        <p>
            Data agency means students see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data. They don't just consume information—they create it, question it, and use it to make their world better.
        </p>
        
        <exploration xml:id="exploration-student-choice">
            <title>From Questions to Action</title>
            
            <p>
                The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 1: Start with student concerns</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What's something about our school/community/world that you're curious about or want to change?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 2: Help them find the data angle</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What information would help us understand this better?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Who could we ask?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What could we count or measure?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 3: Support investigation planning</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>How will we collect this information fairly?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What do we predict we'll find?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Who should know about our results?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 4: Celebrate their expertise</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What did you discover that adults might not know?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>How could this information help make decisions?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>What would you want to investigate next?</q>

            <title>Real Examples of Student Data Agency</title>
            <p>
                <em>Elementary:</em> Third graders survey classmates about lunch preferences and present findings to cafeteria staff, leading to a new menu option.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Middle School:</em> Students investigate whether the school's recycling program is working by tracking waste data and propose improvements to the principal.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>High School:</em> Students analyze local census data to understand demographic changes in their community and present findings at a town hall meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key: Students see their questions as worthy of investigation and their findings as valuable to decision-makers.

        <p>
            Congratulations! You've built the foundation for all data science education. The habits of curiosity, skepticism, and ethical thinking you develop through Data Dispositions and Responsibilities will support everything else your students do with data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In our next module, <em>Creation and Curation</em>, we'll explore how to help students collect, organize, and clean data for investigation. You'll learn practical strategies for everything from student surveys to using existing datasets.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Remember: Data dispositions aren't something you teach once and move on. These are ongoing practices that deepen throughout the year and across all subject areas.
