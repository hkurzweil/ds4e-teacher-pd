    <title>Module 1: Data Dispositions and Responsibilities</title>
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Welcome to the foundation of data science education! This module focuses on developing the right <em>mindset</em> for working with data—both for you and your students.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Data Dispositions and Responsibilities isn't about memorizing definitions or learning technical skills. It's about cultivating curiosity, healthy skepticism, and ethical thinking. These are the habits of mind that make everything else in data science meaningful and responsible.

        <title>Building Data Curiosity and Questioning Skills</title>
        
        <p>
            Data science begins with curiosity—wondering about the world and asking questions that can be explored through information. But not all questions are <q>data questions.</q> Let's explore what makes a good question for data investigation and how to help students develop this skill.

                    A student asks, <q>What's the best color?</q> Why wouldn't this make a good data investigation question?

            <answer>
                <p>
                    This is purely opinion-based with no objective answer that data could reveal.
                </p>
            </answer>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    While you could survey people about color preferences, there's no objective <q>best</q> color to discover through data. Good data questions are specific, measurable, and can be answered by collecting information. A better version might be <q>What colors do students in our class prefer for their bedroom walls?</q> This transforms opinion into investigable preferences within a specific population.

            <title>Try This Week: Notice and Wonder</title>

                <em>Time needed:</em> 10 minutes, works with any content
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Strategy:</em> Whenever you present any information to students (a graph, a historical fact, a scientific observation), pause and ask: <q>What do you notice?</q> and <q>What do you wonder?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Example with a simple bar graph showing class pet preferences:</em> Students might notice: <q>Dogs got twice as many votes as cats</q> or <q>Nobody chose fish.</q> Students might wonder: <q>Would this be the same in other classes?</q> or <q>Do kids who have pets vote differently than kids who don't?</q>

        <title>Recognizing Bias and Developing Ethical Data Thinking</title>
        
        <p>
            One of the most important data dispositions is healthy skepticism. Not all data tells the complete story, and students need to develop the habit of asking: <q>What might this data be missing? Who collected this and why?</q> Additionally, when we collect information about people, we have responsibilities.

            <em>This quick video explains bias in data collection in kid-friendly terms.</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let's explore bias through a simple scenario that works for any age:
        </p>
        
        <exploration xml:id="exploration-playground-survey">
            <title>The Playground Survey Problem</title>
            
            <p>
                <em>The Scenario:</em> Jamie wants to find out what the most popular playground activity is at their school. They survey 20 students during recess and find that 15 out of 20 say <q>basketball</q> is their favorite.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Jamie's conclusion:</em> <q>Basketball is definitely the most popular playground activity at our school!</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>What questions should we ask about this conclusion?</em> Where did Jamie conduct the survey? When did they survey? Who did they ask? How did they ask the question? What other information might be helpful?
            </p>
        </exploration>
        
        <exercise xml:id="identifying-bias-sources">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    In the playground survey scenario, what would likely be the MOST significant source of bias?
                </p>
            </statement>
            <hint>
                <p>
                    Think about how the location of data collection might influence the responses.
                </p>
            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Location bias is the biggest issue here. If Jamie surveyed students who were playing basketball or near the basketball court, those students would be much more likely to say basketball is their favorite activity. This shows how WHERE we collect data can significantly influence the results, even with good intentions.

                <p>
                    Random selection from class lists would give every student an equal chance to participate, regardless of which playground activity they prefer. Jamie could also survey at different times and locations, but random selection is the most systematic approach to reducing bias.

            </hint>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Understanding that bias is normal and usually unintentional helps students approach data with healthy skepticism rather than cynicism. Most data collectors aren't trying to mislead—they're just limited by practical constraints. Teaching students to ask good questions about data sources and methods helps them become better consumers and creators of information.

        <p>
            The best data scientists aren't necessarily the most technical—they're the most curious and persistent. They ask follow-up questions, notice unexpected patterns, and aren't satisfied with surface-level answers. They also see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data.

            <p>
                This activity helps students develop the habit of asking follow-up questions—the heart of investigation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>How it works:</em> Start with any simple observation or data point from your subject area. Students practice asking <q>But why?</q> and <q>What else could explain this?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Example Chain (Science/Elementary):</em> Observation: <q>Most kids in our class like sunny days better than rainy days.</q> → <q>But why do they prefer sunny days?</q> → <q>Do kids in places where it rains a lot feel differently?</q> → <q>Do adults feel the same way as kids?</q> → <q>How do people's daily activities change with weather?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Example Chain (Social Studies/Secondary):</em> Data point: <q>Social media usage among teens has increased 40% in the past five years.</q> → <q>What factors contributed to this increase?</q> → <q>How does usage vary by geographic region or economic status?</q> → <q>What were teens doing with that time before social media?</q> → <q>How do we measure the effects of this change?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Notice how each question opens up new possibilities for investigation? This is the investigative mindset in action.

            Data agency means students see themselves as capable of asking important questions and finding answers through data. They don't just consume information—they create it, question it, and use it to make their world better.

            <p>
                The most powerful data investigations come from students' own questions about issues they care about. Here's how to support student-driven inquiry:
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 1: Start with student concerns</em> - <q>What's something about our school/community/world that you're curious about or want to change?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 2: Help them find the data angle</em> - <q>What information would help us understand this better? Who could we ask? What could we count or measure?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 3: Support investigation planning</em> - <q>How will we collect this information fairly? What do we predict we'll find? Who should know about our results?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Step 4: Celebrate their expertise</em> - <q>What did you discover that adults might not know? How could this information help make decisions? What would you want to investigate next?</q>
            </p>
        </exploration>
        
        <exercise xml:id="supporting-student-agency">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    When a student proposes investigating something they care about, what's the most important thing to do?

                    Help them transform their interest into investigable questions. This maintains their ownership and motivation while building their skills in formulating data questions. Rather than providing pre-existing datasets or changing their topic to something easier, we honor their curiosity and help them develop the tools to investigate what they care about. This builds both skills and confidence.

            <p>
                <em>Option 2: Wonder Wednesday</em> - Every Wednesday, present one piece of information (graph, fact, image) and ask <q>What do you notice? What do you wonder?</q>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <em>Option 3: Bias Detective Friday</em> - Every Friday, spend 10 minutes examining a claim or data source with your detective questions from this module.
